# Zillow iFrame Integration

## üìñ Introduction

Integrating real estate search functionalities often involves complex APIs or geographic limitations. Zillow, one of the most popular platforms, imposes strict CAPTCHA measures, making it challenging to work with its API. This project provides a simple solution: embedding Zillow search results in an iframe. Users can enter an address, and Zillow's search results dynamically load without the need for API integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üèóÔ∏è Structure
1. **Input Field**: Collects the address to be searched.
2. **Submit Button**: Triggers the iframe to load Zillow results for the given address.
3. **iFrame**: Displays the Zillow search page dynamically.
4. **Close Button**: A Material-UI styled button that clears the iframe and hides it.

### üîÑ Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user enters an address in the input field.
2. **Search Trigger**: Clicking "Submit" encodes the address into a Zillow-compatible URL and loads it into the iframe.
3. **Result Display**: The iframe appears with Zillow's search results.
4. **Close Interaction**: Clicking the "X" button hides the iframe and resets its content.

## üöÄ Running the Project

1. **Save the Files**: Save the project as `index.html`.
2. **Start a Local Server**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. **Open in Browser: Go to http://localhost:8000.
